      <h1>Community Code of Conduct</h1>
      <h4>Last updated: 20.2.2024</h4>
    </div>
    <section class="article">
      <p>Welcome friend! We're very excited to have you as a part of our amazing community! Before you get started, make sure to familiarize yourself with our code of conduct by reading the points below.</p>
      <p class="callout">Please remember that this code of conduct may change at any time. However, we always announce when any changes are made in our <a href="https://discord.crystalcaverns.net">Discord</a>, so you will be notified whenever that happens.</p>
      <h2>We kindly ask you to:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Be respectful to others.</h3>
          <p>Every member of the community, including you, is here to have fun. That is why, even though debates can get heated, it is never okay to be disrespectful to anyone.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Only speak and write in English.</h3>
          <p>To ensure everyone can understand what you want to say, we ask you to always use English and only English.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Use common sense.</h3>
          <p>No rule or system can ever be perfect. We hope you can understand what these rules stand for and why we made them. Never blindly follow any rules, but instead adjust your behavior based on them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Be careful with personal information.</h3>
          <p>The internet can be a dangerous place, and while we do our best to keep danger out of our community, we can’t protect everyone entirely. Remember, no member of our team will ever ask you for your password, real name or other personal information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Inform us when any problem arises.</h3>
          <p>While it can sometimes feel easier to solve a problem in the community by yourself, it’s always better to at least inform us about the problem, as we have the tools to solve it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Stay open-minded and willing to learn from others.</h3>
          <p>Anyone can be wrong sometimes, including us. That’s why everyone needs to try to stay open-minded and listen to other’s ideas and opinions. This also applies to us, which is why we’re so eager to receive suggestions from anyone.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Report any bugs you encounter.</h3>
          <p>The systems we build usually contain bugs, which we won’t find even during our own testing. These bugs can negatively affect your or other’s experience, which is why we need you to tell us about them as soon as possible.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>We absolutely do not tolerate:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Discrimination against anyone.</h3>
          <p>Never treat anyone differently based on their age, gender or opinions. Even if you don’t agree with someone, you have to be respectful towards them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Harassment of any kind.</h3>
          <p>Do not threaten, verbally attack others, reveal personal information of others or make others uncomfortable. Griefing is highly discouraged and in extreme cases, punishable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Spamming or unnecessarily pinging others.</h3>
          <p>Everyone hates being annoyed, which is why sending more messages than necessary to anyone or pinging others for no reason or frequently is strictly prohibited.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Cheating or using exploits.</h3>
          <p>While our server isn’t centered on competitive features, it is still severely prohibited to use modifications that give an unfair advantage. (more information in “Allowed modifications”)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Advertising or impersonating.</h3>
          <p>Do not try to impersonate creators, developers or any other players. You can always check if someone is a developer or creator by checking their roles and rank.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Any inappropriate content.</h3>
          <p>This includes, but is not limited to: swearing, insulting jokes or comments, inappropriate names or nicknames, political or religious topics, NSFW content, illegal activities.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="callout">These guidelines are not indefinitely extensive, meaning they don't apply to every situation and can't solve every issue by themselves. That’s where our amazing moderators come in! As such, they have the final say in all situations.</p>
      <h2>Allowed modifications</h2>
      <p>As stated below, cheating or using exploits is prohibited. However, this only applies to modifications that give an <strong>unfair advantage</strong> - but what do we mean by that? </p>
      <p>Simply said, an <strong>“unfair advantage”</strong> is an advantage that <strong>should not be achieved normally</strong> and <strong>makes others' experiences worse</strong> than normally.</p>

      <h3>Examples of what isn't allowed:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hacks or hacked clients</li>
        <li>Resource packs giving an unfair advantage (X-ray)</li>
        <li>Tools made to exploit server and Minecraft mechanics</li>
        <li>Auto-clickers, both software and physical, for example putting something on your mouse to click for you</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Examples of what is allowed:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Purely cosmetic modifications
          <ul>
            <li>Be it resource packs or mods, anything that only changes cosmetic features is allowed.
            </li>
            <li>Please note that our resource pack may override some features of your resource packs. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Performance mods and clients
            <ul>
              <li>These help with keeping high FPS on lower-end hardware, generally making the game run better and allow for shader packs to be used. Great examples are OptiFine or Sodium.                <li>Additionally, players using OptiFine or CIT Resewn on our server can enjoy more QoL updates, even better performance optimization and more!
                </li>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Basically, anything that doesn’t give an unfair advantage is allowed. However, if you use any modification that is not explicitly listed above in the “is allowed” section, you do so at your own risk. If you believe a certain modification should or shouldn’t be listed here, please contact us on Discord.</p>
      <p class="callout">
        On top of not being allowed on our server, cheats and hacking clients are a huge risk to the safety of your account. However, getting your account hacked is not an excuse for any actions your account does and you are still fully responsible for them. If you need help with protecting your account, head over to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/compromised-account-solution">this article on the Microsoft help website.</a>
      </p>
      <h2>Punishments</h2>
      <h3>These are the main offenses we may punish:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Breaking a rule directly
        </li>
        <li>Abusing loopholes knowingly
        </li>
        <li>Influencing others to break rules
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>When we identify a rule-breaker, they may receive one of the following punishments:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A temporary or permanent warning
          <ul>
            <li>Warnings don’t restrict players in any way, as they only exist to help us track frequent rule-breakers and adjust punishments accordingly.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A temporary or permanent chatting restriction
          <ul>
            <li>Chatting restrictions (chat mutes) will block a player's chat or voice messages from reaching other players and thus not allowing them to harass other players.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A temporary or permanent server access restriction
          <ul>
            <li>Server access restrictions (bans) will take away a player’s ability to connect to or view our server, further preventing abuse and harassment.

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The punishments listed above are given to rule-breakers based on two main metrics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Offense severity
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>This metric is mostly determined by how important the rule, which was broken, is to us. We also take into consideration how badly the rule was broken and how much it impacted the experience of other players.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Punishment history
          </h3>
          <ul>When investigating any rule-break, we also look into the given player’s history, giving a harsher punishment if the player has broken many rules in a row.
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our promise to you</h2>
      <p>We, the creators of Crystal Caverns, have built this server, and a safe space for its community, on one simple premise: To allow anyone to have fun playing Minecraft in a new, fresh and exciting environment.</p>

      <h3>To achieve this, we promised our community to always:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Enforce these guidelines fairly and equally.
        </li>
        <li>Provide a safe, fair and exciting environment for everyone’s enjoyment.
        </li>
        <li>Keep our server up to date with new Minecraft versions.</li>
        <li>Add new and interesting features regularly.
        </li>
        <li>Balance existing features with frequent patches.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="callout">Feel free to remind us when we’re doing a bad job at achieving any of these points, since we want to make sure every bit of content we create is the best quality it possibly can be.
      </p>
